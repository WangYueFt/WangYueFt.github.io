I am an Assistant Professor at [USC CS](https://www.cs.usc.edu) (2023 Fall-), leading the [Geometry, Vision, and Learning Lab](https://usc-gvl.github.io). I graduated from MIT EECS in 2022, advised by [Prof. Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon) at the [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup). I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) and [Prof. Phillip Isola](https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/). Previously, I was a master student at University of California, San Diego. Prior to that, I received my BEng in Computer Science from Zhejiang University.  

<!-- I've received the [Nvidia Fellowship](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/graduate-fellowships/) (2020-2021) and the MIT EECS William A. Martin Master’s Thesis Award (2021).  -->


<!-- <span style="color:red">I am looking to hire multiple PhDs/visiting students. In particular, we welcome students from marginalized groups. We firmly support [Viterbi school's DEI initiative](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/) to contribute to diversity. For PhD applicants, please mention my name in your application.

My research lies in the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. My goal is to use machine learning to <strong>enable robotic intelligence with minimal human supervision</strong>. I study how to design 3D learning systems which leverage geometry, appearance, motion, and any other cues that are naturally available in sensory inputs. I am also broadly interested in fundamental deep learning tools and eclectic applications on top of these systems.

Topics I currently focus on include:
* <strong>Simulation.</strong> Constructing photorealistic simulations that replicate rare environments and enabling foundation model learning from synthetic or hybrid data sources.
* <strong>Perception.</strong> Leveraging geometric, semantic, and motional cues to develop data-efficient algorithms for robust scene perception and understanding in both simulated and real-world settings.  
* <strong>Decision Making.</strong> Integrating knowledge from foundation models (such as LLMs) into intelligent agents for humanoids and robotic manipulation in novel and unknown environments.
